<h1 id="about-pycutagi">About py/cuTAGI</h1>

<p>The core developpements of py/cuTAGI have been made by Luong-Ha Nguyen building upon the theoretical work done at Polytechnique Montreal in collaboration with James-A. Goulet, Bhargob Deka, Van-Dai Vuong and Miquel Florensa. The project started in 2018 when, from our background with large-scale state-space models, we foresaw that it would be possible to perform analytical Bayesian inference in neural networks (see below our first try at what would become TAGI).</p>

</p>
<p>Following the early proofs of concepts with small-scale examples with single-layer MLPs, we slowly expanded the development of TAGI for CNN, autoencoders and GANs architectures. Then came proofs of concepts with reinforcement learning toy problems which led to full-scale applications on the Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks. The expansion of TAGIâ€™s applicability to new architectures continued with LSTM networks along with unprecedented features with analytical uncertainty quantification for Bayesian neural networks, analytical adversarial attacks, inference-based optimization, and general-purpose latent-space inference</p>

<p>Despite our repeated successes at leveraging analytical inference in neural network, the key limitation remaining was the lack of a efficient and scalalable library for TAGI; as the method does not relies on Backprop nor gradient descent, it is incompatible with traditionnal libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. In 2021, Luong-Ha Nguyen decided to lead the developpement of the new cuTAGI plateform and later on the pyTAGI API with the objective to open the capabilities of TAGI to the entire community.</p>
